- **Refactoring**: Suggest improvements to existing WordPress code
- **Documentation**: Generate comprehensive PHPDoc comments
- **Testing**: Create unit tests and integration tests
- **Migration**: Help migrate between WordPress versions

### Block Development
Specialized Gutenberg block generation:

- **Dynamic Blocks**: Server-side rendering with PHP
- **Static Blocks**: Pure React/JSX components
- **Block Patterns**: Reusable block combinations
- **Block Variations**: Multiple block styles and configurations
- **Block Transforms**: Convert between block types

## **Performance Characteristics**

### Speed vs Quality Trade-offs
Choose the right model for your needs:

| Model | Speed | Quality | Memory | Use Case |
|-------|-------|---------|--------|----------|
| 7B | Fast | Good | 4GB | Prototyping |
| 13B | Medium | Better | 8GB | Production |
| 70B | Slow | Best | 32GB | Enterprise |

### Token Usage Optimization
Maximize efficiency with proper prompting:

- **Be Specific**: Detailed prompts reduce token waste
- **Use Context**: Reference existing code for better results
- **Batch Requests**: Combine related tasks in single prompts
- **Cache Results**: Store generated code for reuse

### Temperature Settings
Control creativity vs consistency:

- **Low (0.1-0.3)**: Consistent, predictable output
- **Medium (0.4-0.7)**: Balanced creativity and consistency
- **High (0.8-1.0)**: Creative, varied solutions

## **Training Data Sources**

### WordPress Ecosystem
Comprehensive training on WordPress components:

- **WordPress Core**: Complete source code and documentation
- **Plugin Repository**: 60,000+ plugins from WordPress.org
- **Theme Repository**: 10,000+ themes with various architectures

- **Security Guidelines**: WordPress security best practices and guidelines

### Code Quality Standards
Training on high-quality WordPress code:

- **WordPress Coding Standards**: PSR compliance and WordPress-specific rules
- **Security Best Practices**: Sanitization, validation, and capability checks
- **Performance Optimization**: Query optimization and caching strategies
- **Accessibility Standards**: WCAG compliance and inclusive design

## **Model Limitations**

### Current Limitations
Understanding model constraints:

- **Context Window**: Limited to 8K tokens per request
- **Real-time Data**: Cannot access current WordPress version changes
- **Custom Codebases**: May not understand highly customized implementations
- **Third-party Integrations**: Limited knowledge of external services

### Mitigation Strategies
Work around limitations effectively:

- **Break Down Tasks**: Split complex requests into smaller parts
- **Provide Context**: Include relevant code snippets and documentation
- **Iterative Development**: Build and refine code incrementally
- **Manual Review**: Always review generated code before production use
